## A - Overview

In the free tier _(serverless)_, after `23h`, your database will be **hibernated** and the status will change to **StandBy**.

From there it needs to be resumed or **the first request will fail**. This first request will also replace the database in `Active` mode after a few seconds.

## B - Prerequisites

- You should have an [Astra account](http://astra.datastax.com/)

## C - Procedure

The idea here is to trigger an harmless request to access to the health TAB to change the status of the Database.

**âœ… Step 1: Trigger a request**

- Access the database by clicking its name in the menu on the left
