## A - Overview

**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required and $25.00 USD credit every month (_roughly 20M reads/writes, 80GB storage monthly_) which is sufficient to run small production workloads.

## B - Prerequisites

- You should have an [Astra account](https://astra.dev/3B7HcYo). If you don't have one yet, keep reading and we'll show you how to create it.

## C - Procedure

**‚úÖ Step 1:Click the `sign-in` button to login or register.**

You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`. Make sure to chose a password with a minimum of 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, and at least one number and special character.

> If you already have an Astra account, you can skip this step. Locate and click the "Create Database" button on the left-side navigation bar
> of your Astra UI, and read the next step.

**‚úÖ Step 2: Complete the creation form**

_As you create a new account, you will be prompted to create a database; you will see the same form if you simply
hit the "Create database" button in your existing Astra account._

- **‚ÑπÔ∏è Fields Description**

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **database name**  | It does not need to be unique, is not used to initialize a connection, and is only a label (Between 2 and 50 characters). It is recommended to have a database for each of your applications. The free tier is limited to 5 databases. |
| **keyspace**       | It is a logical grouping of your tables (Between 2 and 48 characters). Please use lower case and `snake_case`.                                                                                                                  |
| **Cloud Provider** | Use the one you like. Click a cloud provider logo, pick an Area in the list and finally pick a region. We recommend choosing a region that is closest to you to reduce latency. In free tier, there is very little difference.                      |

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è `Create Database` button becomes enabled only when all fields are filled in properly. Please use only lower case and no spaces for a keyspace name.

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è You will see your new database `pending` in the Dashboard. The status will change to `Active` when the database is ready, which will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

**‚úÖ Step 3: Download your token**

The database will take about a minute to inialize. Progression can be seen on the right panel  (_**Pending - Deployed to region...**, in the screenshot below_).

- Download your token file it will be useful later to use the DB.

**‚úÖ Step 4: You are all set**

When the status is changed to `Your Database is now active` you are good to go

- Click `[Go To Database]`.
