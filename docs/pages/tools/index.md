- **[Apache Airflow](integration/apache-airflow)**: Apache Airflow is an open source workflow management system. It provides components which allow engineers to build data pipelines between different systems.

- **[Apache Nifi](integration/apache-nifi)**: NiFi was built to automate the flow of data between systems. While the term 'dataflow' is used in a variety of contexts, we use it here to mean the automated and managed flow of information between systems.

- **[Apache Spark](integration/apache-spark):** Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed processing system used for big data workloads. It utilizes in-memory caching, and optimized query execution for fast analytic queries against data of any size. Use Apache Spark to connect to your database and begin accessing your Astra DB tables using Scala in spark-shell.

- **[Celery](integration/celery):** Celery is an open-source, distributed task queue written in Python. With Celery you can run tasks (e.g. processing of messages) in an asynchronous fashion. Celery supports a variety of message buses and backends: among the supported backends are Cassandra and Astra DB.

- **[Cloud Functions (Python Driver)](../develop/platform/google-cloud-function.md)**: Google's function-as-a-service offering that provides a serverless execution environment for your code. Cloud Functions are commonly used to extend Astra DB with additional data processing capabilities and connect Astra DB with other cloud services into data pipelines.

- **[Cloud Functions (Python SDK)](../develop/platform/google-cloud-function.md)**: Google's function-as-a-service offering that provides a serverless execution environment for your code. Cloud Functions are commonly used to extend Astra DB with additional data processing capabilities and connect Astra DB with other cloud services into data pipelines.

- **[Cql Proxy](../astra/cqlproxy)**: cql-proxy is designed to forward your application's CQL traffic to an appropriate database service. It listens on a local address and securely forwards that traffic.

- **[Cql Shell](../data/explore/cqlsh)**: the standalone CQLSH client is a separate, lightweight tool you can use to interact with your database.

- **[Datagrip Jetbrains](../data/explore/datagrip.md):** DataGrip is a database management environment for developers. It is designed to query, create, and manage databases. Databases can work locally, on a server, or in the cloud. Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and more. If you have a JDBC driver, add it to DataGrip, connect to your DBMS, and start working.

- **[DataStax Bulk](../data/load/dsbulk.md):** The DataStax Bulk Loader tool (DSBulk) is a unified tool for loading into and unloading from Cassandra-compatible storage engines, such as OSS Apache Cassandra®, DataStax Astra and DataStax Enterprise (DSE).

- **[DBeaver](../data/explore/dbeaver.md)**: DBeaver is a universal database management tool for everyone who needs to work with data in a professional way. With DBeaver you are able to manipulate with your data like in a regular spreadsheet, create analytical reports based on records from different data storages, export information in an appropriate format.

- **[Feast](integration/feast):** Celery is an open-source, distributed task queue written in Python. With Celery you can run tasks (e.g. processing of messages) in an asynchronous fashion. Celery supports a variety of message buses and backends: among the supported backends are Cassandra and Astra DB.

- **[IntelliJ IDEA](ide/intellij.md)**: The Capable & Ergonomic Java IDE by JetBrains

- **[JanusGraph](../tools/databases/janusgraph.md):** JanusGraph is designed to support the processing of graphs so large that they require storage and computational capacities beyond what a single machine can provide. Scaling graph data processing for real time traversals and analytical queries is JanusGraph’s foundational benefit. This section will discuss the various specific benefits of JanusGraph and its underlying, supported persistence solutions.

- **[Micronaut](../develop/frameworks/micronaut.md)**: Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin, and Groovy. Micronaut is developed by the creators of the Grails framework and takes inspiration from lessons learnt over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to microservices using Spring, Spring Boot and Grails.

- **[MindsDB](../data/explore/mindsdb.md)**:MindsDB enables you to use ML predictions in your database using SQL.

- **[Pentaho Data Integration](integration/pentaho.md)**: Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) provides the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) capabilities that facilitate the process of capturing, cleansing, and storing data using a uniform and consistent format that is accessible and relevant to end users and IoT technologies.

- **[TablePlus](../data/explore/tableplus.md):** TablePlus is a modern, native tool with elegant UI that allows you to simultaneously manage multiple databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server and more.
