## Overview

Astra can be a little tricky to get started with when working inside a Jupyter notebook. This sample notebook shows how to connect to Astra, create a new database, download the secure connect bundle, and load and index data into tables. Finally, just because it's a notebook, we'll train and plot the test error from the sample dataset.
