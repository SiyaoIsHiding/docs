    [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) is an open-source, unified programming model for batch and streaming data processing pipelines that simplifies large-scale data processing dynamics. Thousands of organizations around the world choose Apache Beam due to its unique data processing features, proven scale, and powerful yet extensible capabilities.

    **Definition of Pipeline**

    A pipeline is made up of multiple steps, that takes some input, operates on that data, and finally produces output. The steps that operates on the data are called PTransforms (parallel transforms), and the data is always stored in PCollections (parallel collections). The PTransform takes one item at a time from the PCollection and operates on it. The PTransform are assumed to be hermetic, using no global state, thus ensuring it will always produce the same output for the given input. These properties allow the data to be sharded into multiple smaller dataset and processed in any order across multiple machines. The code you write ends up being very simple, but is able to seamlessly split across 100s of machines.

### Google DataFlow

Google Dataflow is an hosted version of `Apache Beam` hosted in google cloud platform.

Google Dataflow is a cloud-based data processing service that allows users to build and execute data pipelines. It enables the processing of large amounts of data in a parallel and distributed manner, making it scalable and efficient. Dataflow supports both batch and streaming processing, allowing for real-time data analysis. Users can write data processing pipelines using a variety of programming languages such as Java, Python, and SQL. Dataflow also provides integration with other Google Cloud services, such as BigQuery and Pub/Sub.
