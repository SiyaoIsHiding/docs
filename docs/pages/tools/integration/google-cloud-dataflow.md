    Google Dataflow is an hosted version of `Apache Beam` hosted in google cloud platform.

    Google Dataflow is a cloud-based data processing service that allows users to build and execute data pipelines. It enables the processing of large amounts of data in a parallel and distributed manner, making it scalable and efficient. 

    Dataflow supports both batch and streaming processing, allowing for real-time data analysis. Users can write data processing pipelines using a variety of programming languages such as Java, Python, and SQL. Dataflow also provides integration with other Google Cloud services, such as BigQuery and Pub/Sub.
