## Overview

Cadence is a multi-tenant orchestration framework that helps with managing workflows. It scales horizontally to handle millions of concurrent executions from various customers. Cadence Open Sources uses docker compose to run their server, and uses Apache Cassandra‚ìá as its default backend dependency. Using docker compose, users are able to also use Cadence with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Statsd+Graphite, and Elasticsearch.

## - Prerequisites

- You should have an [Astra account](http://astra.datastax.com/)
- You should [Create an Astra Database](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Create-an-AstraDB-Instance)
- You should have an [Astra Token](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Create-an-Astra-Token)


!!! note "Note"
     This runbook was written using Mac OS Monterey but it will also work with Windows. Any Windows-specific instructions will be noted as such.  

## Installation and Setup

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Setup Astra
1. In your Astra database, create two new keyspaces called **"cadence"** and **"cadence_visibility".** You will be using both of these in the next steps.
2. Make sure to create an Astra token with **Admin Role**
3. Get your **Database ID**

???+ tip "Find your Database ID in one of two ways:"
    1. Navigate to your your database and get the last ID in the URL: `https://astra.datastax.com/org/.../database/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
    2. Copy and paste the **Datacenter ID** without the trailing `-1` from the **Regions** section of your Astra Dashboard. 


### ‚úÖ Step 2: Cadence Pre-setup

1. Clone this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/melienherrera/cadence-astra-cql-proxy)
2. Navigate to your cloned repository and using your preferred text editor (e.g. VisualStudio or Sublime), update the .env file with your Astra Token and Astra Database ID that you obtained above. 
```
ASTRA_TOKEN=<your Astra token>
ASTRA_DATABASE_ID=<your DB ID>
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Cadence Schema Migration to Astra DB

For this step, you will set up the keyspaces you created earlier in the Astra prerequisites (**cadence** and **cadence_visibility**). You will be using `cadence-cassandra-tool` which is part of the Temporal repo and it relies on schema definition. 

1. Navigate to your cloned `cadence-astra-cql-proxy` directory
2. Run the following commands to initialize the keyspaces that we created through Astra. Note that there are two sets of commands, one for `cadence` keyspace and one for `cadence_visibility` keyspace:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-schema.yaml run cadence \
  -ep cqlproxy-cadence -k cadence setup-schema -v 0.0
docker-compose -f docker-compose-schema.yaml run cadence \
  -ep cql-proxy -k cadence update-schema -d schema/cassandra/cadence/versioned/

docker-compose -f docker-compose-schema.yaml run cadence \
  -ep cql-proxy -k cadence_visibility setup-schema -v 0.0
docker-compose -f docker-compose-schema.yaml run cadence \
  -ep cql-proxy -k cadence_visibility update-schema -d schema/cassandra/visibility/versioned/
```

Once the process is completed, you should see a message similar to this: 

```
2022/04/05 21:50:24 Starting schema setup, config=&{SchemaFilePath: InitialVersion:0.0 Overwrite:false DisableVersioning:false}
2022/04/05 21:50:24 Setting up version tables
2022/04/05 21:50:25 Setting initial schema version to 0.0
2022/04/05 21:50:25 Updating schema update log
2022/04/05 21:50:26 Schema setup complete
...
2022/04/05 22:13:16 ---- Done ----
2022/04/05 22:13:16 Schema updated from 0.32 to 0.33, elapsed 1.4960138s
2022/04/05 22:13:16 All schema changes completed in 32.5941245s
2022/04/05 22:13:16 UpdateSchemeTask done
```

Great! Your schemas have been migrated with Astra DB. 
??? info "Confirm your tables exist in Astra"
    * You can double-check to make sure the correct tables have been created by querying your database in Astra DB‚Äôs CQL Console. 
    * Run `DESC tables;` in both your `cadence` and `cadence_visibility` keyspaces. You should see there are tables loaded in that were created by the schema migration with `cadence-cassandra-tool`.

    ```
    token@cqlsh> use cadence;
    token@cqlsh:cadence> desc tables;

    history_node        schema_version  tasks           history_tree         
    domains_by_name_v2  executions      domains         events               
    cluster_config      queue           queue_metadata  schema_update_history

    token@cqlsh:cadence> use cadence_visibility ;
    token@cqlsh:cadence_visibility> desc tables;

    open_executions        closed_executions_v2  closed_executions
    schema_update_history  schema_version    

    ```

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Run Docker Compose
In this step, the `docker-compose.yaml` file is already provided for you in the `cadence-astra-cql-proxy` repo. This file creates different docker containers to run Temporal server. The persistence layer is configured for you to connect with cql-proxy, and it should pull your Astra credentials from when you set it earlier. 

```
services:
 cql-proxy:
   container_name: cqlproxy
   image: datastax/cql-proxy:v${CQL_PROXY_VERSION}
   ...
   environment:
     - ASTRA_TOKEN=${ASTRA_TOKEN}
     - ASTRA_DATABASE_ID=${ASTRA_DATABASE_ID}
     - HEALTH_CHECK=true
```

Now you can run the docker-compose command to start up Cadence: 
```
docker-compose up
```






### ‚úÖ Step 5: Test and Validate
You can test your connection and play with your Cadence cluster with these instructions.
Using Cadence‚Äôs Command Line tool, you will be able to interact with your local Temporal server.

1. Create a domain `samples-domain` by running the following command. You should see the success message once the domain is created:
```
% cadence --do samples-domain d re
Domain samples-domain successfully registered.
```
2. Clone the sample project repository to your machine. Navigate to this project and run make to build all the projects.
3. Once this is complete, you can start by running the sample Hello World project by following the instructions in that repository.

Once you have this all running, you should be able to see your workflows reflect on both the Cadence UI and Astra UI. You can see the domain on the top left is samples-domain, the domain we created, as well as the Status of each workflow as ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù.
