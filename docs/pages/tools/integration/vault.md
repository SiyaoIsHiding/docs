## Overview

The purpose of this document is to guide you through the process using Astra DB as the storage configuration for your 
HashiCorp Vault instance. In this tutorial, you will install Vault and edit the configuration file to point to Astra DB.

## Prerequisites

<ul class="prerequisites">
  <li class="nosurface">You should have an <a href="https://astra.dev/3B7HcYo">Astra account</a></li>
  <li class="nosurface">You should <a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/">Create an Astra Database</a></li>
  <li class="nosurface">You should <a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/">Have an Astra Token</a></li>
  <li class="nosurface">You should <a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/download-scb/">Download your Secure Bundle</a></li>
<li>You should <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install">Install Vault</a></li>
<li>Clone this<a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install"> repository</a> to use to set up CQL-Proxy which is a sidecar that enables unsupported CQL drivers to work with DataStax Astra
    <ul>
    <li>
    You need your Astra Token and Astra Database ID to use CQL-Proxy
    </li>
    <li>
    Follow the steps in the repo to spin up CQL-Proxy using Terminal/Command Line. Once successfully running, you should see the following output:
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    ```bash
    {"level":"info","ts":1651012815.176512,"caller":"proxy/proxy.go:222","msg":"proxy is listening","address":"[::]:9042"}
    ```
</ul>
  

## Installation and Setup
1. In the Astra UI, create a keyspace called **vault**. 
2. Navigate to your *CQL Console* in the Astra UI. Issue the following statement to create a table called **entries**
```bash
CREATE TABLE vault."entries" (
    bucket text,
    key text,
    value blob,
    PRIMARY KEY (bucket, key)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (key ASC);
```
2. Navigate to your terminal. Create a Vault configuration file `config.hcl` in your local directory.
3. Edit your `config.hcl` file. Copy and paste the following to your configuration file:

```bash
storage "cassandra" {
  hosts            = "localhost"
  consistency      = "LOCAL_QUORUM"
  protocol_version = 3
}

listener "tcp" {
  address     = "127.0.0.1:8200"
  tls_disable = "true"
}

api_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
cluster_addr = "https://127.0.0.1:8201"
ui = true
```
4. Run Vault from your terminal with the following command:

`vault server -config=config.hcl`

Successful output should look like this:
```bash
==> Vault server configuration:

             Api Address: http://127.0.0.1:8200
                     Cgo: disabled
         Cluster Address: https://127.0.0.1:8201
              Go Version: go1.17.9
              Listener 1: tcp (addr: "127.0.0.1:8200", cluster address: "127.0.0.1:8201", max_request_duration: "1m30s", max_request_size: "33554432", tls: "disabled")
               Log Level: info
                   Mlock: supported: false, enabled: false
           Recovery Mode: false
                 Storage: cassandra
                 Version: Vault v1.10.2
             Version Sha: 94325865b12662cb72efa3003d6aaa4f5ae57f3a

==> Vault server started! Log data will stream in below:
```

!!! info "Note"

    If you get a warning message about mlock not being supported, that is okay. However, for maximum security you should run Vault on a system that supports mlock.

## Test and Validate
1. Once you see the above message that you successfully started Vault server, open a new terminal window.
2. Run `vault operator init`. This will give you 5 Unseal Keys and a Root Token. Vault needs 3 Unseal Keys to properly unseal. 
!!! info "Note"
    You may get an error that looks like this
    ```
    Error initializing: Put "https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/init": http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client
    ```
    This is because Vault runs on localhost, but the default address is HTTPS. Instead, you might need to specify the explicit address with the follow command:
    ```
    vault operator init -address=http://127.0.0.1:8200
    ```
Once Vault is initialized, it should give you an output of your Unseal Keys:
```bash
% vault operator init
Unseal Key 1: rVRPym...
Unseal Key 2: 71tY5X...
Unseal Key 3: ETYWDf...
Unseal Key 4: 4mDtrr...
Unseal Key 5: o9X46m...

Initial Root Token: hvs.gF14F...

Vault initialized with 5 key shares and a key threshold of 3. Please securely
distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 3 of these keys to unseal it
before it can start servicing requests.

Vault does not store the generated root key. Without at least 3 keys to
reconstruct the root key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!
```
!!! danger "Note"
    Make sure to save these keys somewhere safe. This is the only time that Vault will generate these keys. 
3. Run the Vault UI at [http://127.0.0.1:8200](http://127.0.0.1:8200)
4. Enter your Unseal Keys and Root Token

<img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/vault/vault_token.png" style="width:250px;"/>

5. You should now be able to access the Vault UI as well as cross-reference your CQL Console to make sure the requests are properly being written to your **entries** table! 

**Note:** When querying from the **entries** table, you must use double-quotes as `entries` is a reserved word for CQL.

```bash
token@cqlsh:vault> use vault;                           //Switches to Vault keyspace
token@cqlsh:vault> expand on;                           //Prints output in readable format
token@cqlsh:vault> select * from "entries" limit 1;     //Select statement from "entries" table
