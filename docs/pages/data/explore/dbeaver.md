3. In the **Main** tab, set the **JDBC URL** to:
   `jdbc:cassandra://;AuthMech=2;TunableConsistency=6;SecureConnectionBundlePath=/path/to/secure-connect-dbeaver.zip`
   **Note** That you will need to specify the full path to _your_ secure bundle.
4. In the **Username** field, enter the string `token`
