## C - Installation and Setup

### ‚úÖ Step 1: JDBC Driver

Download the JDBC driver from the DataStax website:

1. Go to https://downloads.datastax.com/#odbc-jdbc-drivers.
2. Select **Simba JDBC Driver for Apache Cassandra.**
3. Select **JDBC 4.2.**
4. Read the license terms and accept it (click the checkbox).
5. Hit the blue **Download** button.
6. Once the download completes, unzip the downloaded file.

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Import Driver

1. Go to the **Driver Manager.**
2. Click the **New** button.
3. In the **Libraries** tab, click the **Add File** button.
4. Locate the directory where you unzipped the driver download and add the `CassandraJDBC42.jar` file.
5. Click the Find Class button which should identify the driver class as `com.simba.cassandra.jdbc42.Driver`.
6. In the **Settings** tab, set the following:

- Driver Name: `Astra DB`
- Driver Type: `Generic`
- Class Name: `com.simba.cassandra.jdbc42.Driver`

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Create New Connection

Connect to your Astra DB in DBeaver:

1. Open the **New Database Connection** dialog box.
2. Select **Astra DB** from the list of drivers.
3. In the **Main** tab, set the **JDBC URL** to:
   `jdbc:cassandra://;AuthMech=2;TunableConsistency=6;SecureConnectionBundlePath=/path/to/secure-connect-dbeaver.zip`
   **Note** That you will need to specify the full path to _your_ secure bundle.
4. In the **Username** field, enter the string `token`
5. In the **Password** field, paste the value of the token you created in the **Prerequisites** section above. The token looks like `AstraCS:AbC...XYz:123...edf0`.

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Final Test

Connect to your Astra DB. If the connection was successful, you should be able to explore the keyspaces and tables in your DB on the left-hand side of the UI.

Here's an example output:
