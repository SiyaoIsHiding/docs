## Overview

AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy for analytics users to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources. You can use it for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It also includes additional productivity and dataOps tooling for authoring, running jobs, and implementing business workflows.

With AWS Glue, you can discover and connect to more than 70 diverse data sources and manage your data in a centralized data catalog. You can visually create, run, and monitor extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines to load data into your data lakes. Also, you can immediately search and query cataloged data using Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.

- <span class="nosurface">‚ÑπÔ∏è </span>[What is Glue?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/what-is-glue.html)

AWS Glue uses the [Astra JDBC Driver](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/astra-jdbc-connector/releases/download/5.0/astra-jdbc-connector-5.0-jdk8.jar) to connect to Cassandra as the storage backend. The Java driver itself supports connections to Astra DB natively.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial will take you through the process of connecting your Astra database to Glue.  This process is somewhat extensive, so please take care to read all of the instructions carefully.

</ul>

# Step 1 - Setup

## <span class="nosurface">‚úÖ Step 1.1: </span> Put data in your database
1. From the Astra homepage, select your **astraglue_db** database from the list on the left hand side.
2. Click the **Load Data** button at the top of the page.
3. Download this sample <a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/assets/attachments/demographics.csv">CSV file</a>.
4. Drag the CSV file onto the file drop area and then click the **Next** button.
5. Scroll to the bottom and choose a partition key (**country_name**).
6. For "Target Keyspace" use the **astraglue_ks** you created as a prerequisite.
7. Click "Finish".
8. Move on to the next steps, the upload should be done before you need the data.

## <span class="nosurface">‚úÖ Step 1.2: </span> Create Role in IAM

# Step 2 - Glue Connector

Now that all of the pieces have been put in place, it's time to create the connector and connection from Astra to Glue.

## <span class="nosurface">‚úÖ Step 2.1: </span> Create Glue Connector

1. Open the [AWS Glue Studio](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/gluestudio/home) console.
2. In the left hand column, click on **Data connections**.
3. Click on **Create custom connector** in the "Custom connectors" section.
4. Paste the S3 URI for your JDBC driver under **Connector S3 URL**.  If you need to retrieve this URI you can find it by browsing from the [S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home).
5. Choose a **Name** for your connector.
6. Select *JDBC* as the connector type.
7. For the **Class name** enter **com.datastax.astra.jdbc.AstraJdbcDriver**.
8. The JDBC URL base is composed of the following pieces
    - jdbc:astra://<databasename>/<keyspace>?user=token&password=<YourAstraCSToken>
    - If you followed the instructions on naming your db and keyspace it will be:
        - jdbc:astra://astraglue_db/astraglue_ks?user=token&password=AstraCS:YourTokenHere
    - (yes, this is the same username/password you used in the secrets manager, just go with it)
9. For the URL parameter delimiter enter '&'.
