## Overview

AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy for analytics users to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources. You can use it for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It also includes additional productivity and data ops tooling for authoring, running jobs, and implementing business workflows.

With AWS Glue, you can discover and connect to more than 70 diverse data sources and manage your data in a centralized data catalog. You can visually create, run, and monitor extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines to load data into your data lakes. Also, you can immediately search and query cataloged data using Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.

- <span class="nosurface">‚ÑπÔ∏è </span>[What is Glue?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/what-is-glue.html)

DBSchema uses the [Astra JDBC Driver](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/astra-jdbc-connector/releases/download/5.0/astra-jdbc-connector-5.0.jar) to connect to Cassandra as the storage backend. The Java driver itself supports connections to Astra DB natively.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial will take you through the process of connecting your Astra database to Glue.  This process is somewhat extensive, so please take care to read all of the instructions carefully.

<ul class="prerequisites">
  <li class="nosurface">You should have an <a href="https://astra.dev/3B7HcYo">Astra account</a></li>
  <li class="nosurface">You should <a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/">Create an Astra Database</a>(Database: astraglue_db, keyspace: astraglue_ks)</li>
  <li class="nosurface">You should <a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/">Have an Astra Token</a></li>
  <li class="nosurface">You need an <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com">AWS account with permissions for Glue, S3, IAM, and the AWS Secrets Manager</a>
</ul>

# Step 1 - Setup

## <span class="nosurface">‚úÖ Step 1.1: </span> Put data in your database
1. From the Astra homepage, select your **astraglue_db** database from the list on the left hand side.
2. Click the white **Load Data** button at the top of the page.
3. Click "Load a sample dataset"
4. Click "Movies and TV Shows" and then click the black **Next** button
5. Scroll to the bottom and choose a partition key (**show_id**)
6. For "Target Keyspace" use the **astraglue_ks** you created as a prerequisite
7. Click "Finish"
8. Move on to the next steps, the upload should be done before we need the data.

## <span class="nosurface">‚úÖ Step 1.2: </span> Create Role in IAM

1. Open [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home)
2. In the left hand column, select Select **Roles**

    <details>
        <summary>Show me!</summary>
        <img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/awsglue/IAMLeftBar.png" />
    </details>

3. On the right hand side, click the large blue **Create Role** button

4. For your Trusted entity type, choose  **AWS service**.  In the "Use cases for other AWS Services" type and select "Glue".

5. Select **Next.**

6. On the **Add permissions** page you will need to search for a few different permissions.  You should select the following:
    - AmazonS3FullAccess
    - AWSGlueServiceRole
    - AWSGlueConsoleFullAccess
    - SecretsManagerReadWrite

        <summary>Show me!</summary>
        <img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/awsglue/IAMPermissions.png" />
    </details>

7. On the Name, review, and create page, choose a name for your role (For example purposes I will use **AstraGlueRole**), then scroll to the bottom of the page and click the blue **Create role** button.

## <span class="nosurface">‚úÖ Step 1.3: </span> Setup JDBC Driver in S3 

1. Download [Astra JDBC connector jar](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/astra-jdbc-connector/releases/download/5.0/astra-jdbc-connector-5.0.jar)  from Github
2. Open the [S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)
3. Click the orange **Create bucket** button on the right hand side
4. Choose a bucket name - this must be unique across all accounts so you will need to pick something unique to you.
5. Choose which type of permission model to use.  I chose here to use ACLs as they are easier for managing access to buckets and their contents.

        <summary>Show me!</summary>
        <img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/awsglue/s3configuration.png" />
    </details>
6. Scroll to the bottom and click the orange **Create bucket** button.
7. Open the bucket by clicking its name on the bucket listings.
8. Click the orange **Upload** button and follow the steps to upload the driver you just downloaded.
9. Once that's done, from the **Objects** page for your bucket in S3, click on the driver.
10. From here you can copy the S3 URI, which you will need later, or you can get it when it's needed.

## <span class="nosurface">‚úÖ Step 1.4: </span> Secrets Manager

This assumes that you have gone through the process of getting an Astra token for your database.

1. Open the [AWS Secrets Manager](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/listsecrets)
2. Click the orange **Store a new secret** button on the right hand side.
3. Choose **Other type of secret**
4. Add two key/value pairs:
    - user: 'token'
    - password: Your AstraCS token here
5. Click the orange **Next** button at the bottom of the page
6. Choose a secret name like "AstraGlueCreds"
7. On the "Configure Rotation" screen just click **Next**
8. Review the entries then click **Store**

Ok, that was a lot of steps, great job getting things set up. Feel free to take a moment before moving on to the next section.
